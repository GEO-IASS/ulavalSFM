INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

#### If you don't have OpenCV and/or don't have the rights on the computer, here is a way to install it and install bundler_sfm with my script :

DO :

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/LERobot/ulavalSFM
cd <ulavalSFM>/
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This script will :

- Add the new library path to your local LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
- Add the new executable paths to your local PATH
- Add export commands of the new paths in your home .bashrc
- Clone OpenCV with git in \<ulavalSFM_path\>/lib/ directory
- Build OpenCV 2.4.9 and install it in the ulavalSFM directory
- Build bundler_sfm
- Build ulavalSFM and install it in \<ulavalSFM_path\>/bin/ directory

It could take a while. You can add more worker cores by changing the argument after _make -j_ in the script.

Note that is better to install it with a package management system, but if you are on a supercomputer and thus you don't have the permission, this script can save you time.

#### If you already have OpenCV and rights on your computer:

Please make sure openCV libraries are in your local lib folder

DO :

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/LERobot/ulavalSFM
cd <ulavalSFM_path>/lib/
git clone https://github.com/LERobot/bundler_sfm
cd bundler_sfm/
make clean
make
echo "export PATH="$PWD/bin/:$PATH"" >> $HOME/.bashrc
export PATH="$PWD/bin/:$PATH"
cd ../../src/
make
make install
```

Those instructions will build ulavalSFM and install it in \<ulavalSFM_path\>/bin/ directory.
